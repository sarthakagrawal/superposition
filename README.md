need first 7 rows to have first 7 pics to_stars, and then 11 pics to red or to white. Need 4 to red, 3 to white.
Need last 6 rows to have 18 to white (3) or to red (3)

## code instructions
for white stripes, use 'snow' as first color, 'snow2' as second color
for red stripes, use 'IndianRed1' as first color, 'firebrick1' as second color
for stars, use 'NavyBlue' as first color, 'snow2' as second color

Basics:
* A 4"x6" photo costs $0.20
* I want a ~4.75'x9' American flag — giving us 13 rows and 18 columns
	* https://www.inchcalculator.com/american-flag-size-proportions-calculator/
* The idea is to generate 18 sequences of 18-greyscale photos. The photos can then be colored the correct colors (red, white, blue) to make an American flag
* Each row/sequence represents one of the 12 nidanas (the first repeats at the start and end to emphasize the cycle)
